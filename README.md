# Vaccination Tracker

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT%20License-green">

This application stores the vaccination history of the user and displays what vaccinations are recommended for when a person travels to a particular country. Once the user has selected the country they wish to travel, a list shows of the vaccinations recommended and the user is able to select add to cart and it adds the vaccination to their profile page in a shopping list. Once the user has been vaccinated, the vaccination moves to the protected list and shows the user when they are due for a booster.
